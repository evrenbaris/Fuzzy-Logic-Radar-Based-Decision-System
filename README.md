# Fuzzy Logic Radar-Based Decision System

This project uses radar data (distance and speed) with a fuzzy logic system to assess danger levels and make decisions. 

## Features
- Simulates radar data for distance and speed.
- Uses fuzzy logic rules to determine danger levels.
- Visualizes membership functions and the decision-making process.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **scikit-fuzzy**: For fuzzy logic implementation.
- **Matplotlib**: For visualization.
- **Pandas**: For data handling.

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas scikit-fuzzy matplotlib
